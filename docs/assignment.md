# Next.js Assignment

## Overview

This project is a simple Next.js application built with TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and React. Your task is to implement a **search feature** for users and display the search results in a table. Additionally, you will need to provide options to **clear the search results**, **view detailed user information**, and **add new users** through a modal form.

## Assignment Tasks

### Primary Objective: User Search Functionality

1. **Search Input**:

- Add a search input field at the top of the user table.
- Allow the user to type in the search input to filter users by **name** or **email**.
- Implement debouncing (optional but recommended) to avoid triggering too many search requests as the user types.

2. **Displaying Search Results**:

- When the user enters a search query, update the table to display only the users that match the search term (by name or email).
- If no users match the search term, display a message such as "No users found."

3. **Clear Search**:

- Add a "Clear Search" button or option near the search input field.
- When this button is clicked, clear the search input and restore the table to show all users.

4. **State Management**:

- Store the user data in the component state or context.
- Update the state based on the search query and clear search actions.

### Additional Tasks for the Assignment

1. **Detailed User View**:

- Implement a user-friendly modal or separate page that displays detailed information about a user when their name is clicked in the user table.

2. **Adding New Users**:

- Implement a modal form using React Hook Form to add new users to the table.
- Ensure the form includes fields for the user's name, email, and any other relevant information.
- Use Zod for form validation and display appropriate error messages for invalid inputs.
- When the form is submitted, add the new user to the table and update the component state or context.
- Provide an option to close the modal without submitting the form, and ensure the modal can be closed by clicking outside of it or by pressing the escape key.

### Additional Enhancements (Optional)

- **User Avatar**: Add an avatar image next to each user's name in the table to make the UI more visually appealing.
- **Pagination**: Implement pagination for the user table to handle large datasets efficiently.
- **Sorting**: Allow sorting of users by name or email by clicking on the table headers.
- **React Query Setup**: If you're willing, please set up React Query for handling services.

These enhancements are not mandatory but can help you stand out and impress us! ðŸŒŸ

### Bonus Objectives:

- **Styling**:

  - Ensure that the search input, table, and clear button are styled using TailwindCSS.
  - The layout should be responsive and look good on different screen sizes.

- **User Experience Enhancements**:

  - Implement **debouncing** for the search input to delay the search until the user stops typing (for example, wait 300ms after the user stops typing before applying the search).
  - Use a **loading indicator** when fetching user data or when the search query is being processed.

- **Performance Considerations**:

  - Optimize the search functionality by using **memoization** or other techniques to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

- **Unit tests**
  - Implement unit tests.

### Data Source

You can use static mock data or fetch the user list from an external API such as [JSONPlaceholder Users](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users). Make sure the table is populated with users, and the search functionality works on this dataset.

## Project Structure

The project should follow the following structure.

```bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ app             # Next.js pages
â”œâ”€â”€ src             # Source files
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ public      # Public assets (images, fonts, etc.)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ styles      # Tailwind CSS config and global styles
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ types       # TypeScript interfaces and types

### Explanation:

- **Primary Objective**: The assignment focuses on implementing a search feature for filtering users and providing the ability to clear the search results.
- **Bonus Objectives**: Includes optional tasks such as debouncing the search input, adding a loading indicator, and ensuring responsiveness using TailwindCSS.
- **Review Criteria**: Outlines the key areas you will evaluate during the code review: code quality, completeness, responsiveness, state management, and performance.
