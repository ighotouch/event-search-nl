## Tests for User Search Functionality

This document outlines the tests for the user search functionality in the Next.js application. The tests cover the primary objectives and bonus objectives mentioned in the `assignment.md` file.

### Test Cases

#### 1. Search Input

- **Test Case 1.1**: Verify that the search input field is rendered at the top of the user table.
- **Test Case 1.2**: Verify that typing in the search input filters users by name.
- **Test Case 1.3**: Verify that typing in the search input filters users by email.
- **Test Case 1.4**: Verify that debouncing is implemented to avoid triggering too many search requests.

#### 2. Displaying Search Results

- **Test Case 2.1**: Verify that the table updates to display only the users that match the search term (by name or email).
- **Test Case 2.2**: Verify that a message "No users found" is displayed when no users match the search term.

#### 3. Clear Search

- **Test Case 3.1**: Verify that the "Clear Search" button or option is rendered near the search input field.
- **Test Case 3.2**: Verify that clicking the "Clear Search" button clears the search input.
- **Test Case 3.3**: Verify that clicking the "Clear Search" button restores the table to show all users.

#### 4. State Management

- **Test Case 4.1**: Verify that user data is stored in the component state or context.
- **Test Case 4.2**: Verify that the state is updated based on the search query.
- **Test Case 4.3**: Verify that the state is updated when the search is cleared.

### Bonus Tests

#### 5. Styling

- **Test Case 5.1**: Verify that the search input, table, and clear button are styled using TailwindCSS.
- **Test Case 5.2**: Verify that the layout is responsive and looks good on different screen sizes.

#### 6. User Experience Enhancements

- **Test Case 6.1**: Verify that debouncing is implemented for the search input (e.g., wait 300ms after the user stops typing before applying the search).
- **Test Case 6.2**: Verify that a loading indicator is displayed when fetching user data or when the search query is being processed.

#### 7. Performance Considerations

- **Test Case 7.1**: Verify that memoization or other techniques are used to optimize the search functionality and avoid unnecessary re-renders.
